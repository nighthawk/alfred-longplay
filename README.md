# Alfred Workflow for Longplay for Mac

See GitHub releases for download of the workflow, and see the `scripts` folder for the individual JXA scripts.

Crafted by Adrian Schoenig

## Updating the workflow

A manual process for now (see [official docs](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/guides-and-tutorials/share-workflow-on-github/)):

1. Update in Alfred, select "Export..."
2. Manually update the scripts in this repo and push
3. Create a new release and drop in the file from step 1.

(If anyone has a better way to do this, let me know.)
